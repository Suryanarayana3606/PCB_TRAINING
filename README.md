✅ L298N – Dual H-Bridge Motor Driver IC
The L298N is a high-current, high-voltage dual full-bridge driver designed to drive inductive loads such as DC and stepper motors. It can control the direction and speed of two DC motors simultaneously.
Key Features:
- Operates up to 46V and 2A per channel
- Built-in diodes for back EMF protection
- Compatible with logic-level signals (TTL/CMOS)
- Ideal for robotics and motor control applications

✅ 78M05 – Voltage Regulator IC
The 78M05 is a medium-current +5V voltage regulator used to power the logic circuitry of the L298N. It steps down the motor supply voltage to a regulated 5V output.
Key Features:
- Output Voltage: +5V
- Output Current: up to 500mA
- Built-in thermal and short-circuit protection
- Ensures stable operation of L298N logic section
